# Hypothesis-Testing


I studied hypothesis testing about a year ago and was quite confident that I've learned enough. About 2 weeks ago I wanted to recollect how hypothesis testing works and I realized that I did not even understand the fundamental well. So I decided to relearn it and also document my learning well this time. 
This drepository contains the Rproject, the R markdown file and also the PDF file which contains all the information and the output of my learning.
